## Wealth Projection


<p>We present a simple projection used for financial planning.<p>

<p>Based on the level of risk that you are willing to take and the level of returns that you are expecting, a prediction of your future wealth can be made. </p>

## Calculating the expected wealth

<p>The expected wealth can be computed from the initial wealth and the expected returns.</p>

<p>Obviously, the higher the expected returns, the faster the wealth will grow.</p>

## Using the Risk

<p>With higher risks, there will be a greater variability in the actual wealth that is accumulated.</p>

<p>The higher the risks, the greater the spread between the upper and lower lines.</p>

## Putting it together

<p>The graph gives you some sense of how risk and return are related to each other.</p>

<p>However, you will need to assess whether the expected returns and desired risks are appropriate in the current investment climate.</p>
